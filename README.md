This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for statistical and experimental design analyses using conjoint analysis and fractional factorial design methods.

Conjoint analysis.ipynb

Purpose: This notebook provides a framework for performing conjoint analysis,
        a technique commonly used in market research to determine how people value different features that make up a product or service.
        
Contents:
Data preparation for conjoint analysis.
Calculation of utilities for different attributes.
Visualization of results to interpret consumer preferences.

Fractional factorial for Combinations.ipynb

Purpose: This notebook demonstrates the use of fractional factorial design for generating combinations in experimental setups. 
         Fractional factorial designs reduce the number of experimental runs by only considering a subset of all possible combinations, 
         which is useful for handling a large number of factors.
         
Contents:
Generation of fractional factorial design using pyDOE or related libraries.
Steps to define factors, levels, and combinations.
Visualization and interpretation of factorial combinations.
